								<h2><a href="#">Ch!p In Application</a></h2>
								<p>
									An interactive app that allows users to post and seek volunteer opportunities.

                            <p>
								Ch!p In was a project that I worked on with a team for a digital design course in my second year. We were asked to create an app that promoted social responsibility. Together, we as a team discussed what we would have liked to benefit from having an app that was in line with social responsibility. We all agreed that while we were in highschool, helping out our communities and getting our volunteer hours was an issue for all of us. This problem also carried over into our university careers. We all still wanted to be involved in our communities but found it hard to find volunteer opportunities. Therefore, Ch!p In was created.

									<h3>How It Works</h3>
								</header>
								<p>
		Ch!p In works in two ways. You are either a business/organization looking for volunteers or you are an individual looking for volunteer opportunities. When you select your purpose for the app, it then allows you to either post an opportunity or search for one in your surrounding area using your location. The app also allows you to connect to LinkedIn, allowing for organizations to see your credentials.

									<h3>Design Aspects</h3>
								</header>
								<p>
		When designing Ch!p In as a prototype we wanted it to be very user friendly. We achieved this by allowing users to not have to leave the application to do anything. Contacting volunteers could be done within the app, seeing postings could be done through a map in the application and posting opportunities was done through a form. We used a design board process by finding images, shapes and colours we all liked and found a common ground on how we wanted it to look. Overall, Ch!p In became a very clean, simplistic and user friendly app.
