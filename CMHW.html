								<h2><a href="http://www.childrensmentalhealthweek.ca/">Childrensmentalhealthweek.ca</a></h2>
								<p>
									To promote anti-stigma against mental health, we created an interactive quilt that had mental health resources for children and youth.

								Childrens Mental Health Week was a very busy week for the Education Learning Services Department and I. In one week we pulled off creating an entire website that was to promote anti-stigma and give resources for children and youth. This website had a total of 49 mental health resources ranging from facts about mental health to videos we created with social workers and clincians at the Child Parent Resource Institute.

									<h3>Website Analytics</h3>
								</header>
								<p>
		The goal of this website was to attract users from all over Ontario and even the world. We used Google Analytics on this website to track where we were getting the most traffic from. Since the Child Parent Resource Institute is a provincial organization our goal was to also reach children and youth in northern Ontario. Using our analytics we were able to see that we had reached many users in Sudbury and North Bay.

									<h3>Social Media Management</h3>
								</header>
								<p>
		For Childrenâ€™s Mental Health Week we also wanted to reach users through social media. I was given the role of managing our twitter account to reach out to let mental health organizations around the world know about this great resource that we created. I also reached out to youth groups within the London Ontario community in hopes that they would direct children to our website. Overall, it was a great learning experience and the feedback I was given over Twitter was extremely positive and supportive.
